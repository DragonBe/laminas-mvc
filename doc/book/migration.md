# Migration Guide

## Upgrading to 2.7

### Middleware

laminas-mvc now registers `Laminas\Mvc\MiddlewareListener` as a dispatch listener at
a priority higher than `Laminas\Mvc\DispatchListener`, allowing dispatch of
[PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) middleware. Read the
[middleware chapter](middleware.md) for details on how to use this new feature.

### Application

The constructor signature of `Laminas\Mvc\Application` has changed. Previously, it
was:

```php
__construct($configuration, ServiceManager $serviceManager)
```

and internally, it pulled the services `EventManager`, `Request`, and `Response`
from the provided `$serviceManager` during initialization.

The new constructor signature provides optional arguments for injecting the
event manager, request, and response:

```php
__construct(
    $configuration,
    ServiceManager $serviceManager,
    EventManager $events = null,
    RequestInterface $request = null,
    ResponseInterface $response = null
)
```

This change makes all dependencies explicit. Starting in v3.0, the new arguments
will be *required*.

The factory `Laminas\Mvc\Service\ApplicationFactory` was updated to follow the new
signature.

This change should only affect users who are manually instantiating the
`Application` instance.

### EventManagerAware initializers

laminas-mvc provides two mechanisms for injecting event managers into
`EventManagerAware` objects. One is the "EventManagerAwareInitializer"
registered in `Laminas\Mvc\Service\ServiceManagerConfig`, and the other is the
`Laminas\Mvc\Controller\ControllerManager::injectEventManager()` initializer. In
both cases, the logic was updated to be forwards compatible with
laminas-eventmanager v3. 

Previously each would check if the instance's `getEventManager()` method
returned an event manager instance, and, if so, inject the shared event manager:

```php
$events = $instance->getEventManager();
if ($events instanceof EventManagerInterface) {
    $events->setSharedManager($container->get('SharedEventManager'));
}
```

In laminas-eventmanager v3, event manager's are now injected with the shared
manager at instantiation, and no setter exists for providing the shared manager.
As such, the above logic changed to:

```php
$events = $instance->getEventManager();
if (! $events || ! $events->getSharedManager()) {
    $instance->setEventManager($container->get('EventManager'));
}
```

In other words, it re-injects with a new event manager instance if the instance
pulled does not have a shared manager composed.

This likely will not cause regressions in existing code, but may be something to
be aware of if you were previously depending on lazy-loaded event manager
state.

### ServiceLocatorAware initializers

laminas-servicemanager v3.0 removes `Laminas\ServiceManager\ServiceLocatorAwareInterface`.
Since laminas-mvc provides initializers around that interface, they needed updates
to allow both forwards compatibility with laminas-servicemanager v3 as well as
backwards compatibility with existing applications.

This was accomplished in two ways:

- The abstract controller implementations no longer implement
  `ServiceLocatorAwareInterface`, but continue to define the methods that the
  interface defines (namely `setServiceLocator()` and `getServiceLocator()`.
- The initializers registered by `Laminas\Mvc\Service\ServiceManagerConfig` and
  `Laminas\Mvc\Controller\ControllerManager` now use duck-typing to determine if
  an instance requires container injection; if so it will do so.

However, we also maintain that service locator injection is an anti-pattern;
dependencies should be injected directly into instances instead. As such,
starting in 2.7.0, we now emit a deprecation notice any time an instance is
injected by one of these initializers, and we plan to remove the initializers
for version 3.0. The deprecation notice includes the name of the class, to help
you identify what instances you will need to update before the laminas-mvc v3
release.
